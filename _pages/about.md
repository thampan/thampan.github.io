Hello! I am Jishnu, a software engineer currently based in Germany and in this space, I would like to share some of the interesting technical articles, links and some "hacks" which I found useful.

The articles posted here would be mainly related to C/C++/Python/Bash, Linux, Networking and Embedded systems. Let's strive together to be a better software craftsman.
