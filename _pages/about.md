Hello! I am Jishnu, a software engineer currently based in Germany and in this space, I would like to share some of the interesting technical articles, links and some "hacks" which I found useful.

The articles posted here would be mainly related to C/C++, Linux, Networking and Embedded systems since those are of my interest. The motive here is to share the knowledge to make each one of us a better software craftsman.
